# Poll App

This is a simple poll app that allows users to create a poll and vote on it. You can see the live demo [here](https://poll-5vkajgh8z-haniehmhf.vercel.app).

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and install dependencies:

```
 npm install
```

Next, run locally:

```
 npm start
```

## Testing

I have added some tests to the VotePage component to test the render results and also some interactions on the whole flow. I'm aware it's not a good test coverage for the project and more tests should be added. To run the tests:

```
 npm test
```

## Things to improve

- Improve renders by optimizing the data flow and state management
- Add more tests
- Add more validations
- Add more error handling
- Use modern CSS tools like Emotion or Styled Components
